This enables teams to preserve AI-assisted development context alongside their code.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- A git repository (can be any test repo)\n- Claude Code CLI installed\n- `claudit` binary built and in PATH\n\n## Test 1: Initialize claudit in a repository\n```bash\ncd /path/to/test-repo\nclaudit init\n```\n**Expected:**\n- ✓ Creates/updates `.claude/settings.local.json` with PostToolUse hook\n- ✓ Installs git hooks (pre-push, post-merge, post-checkout)\n- Verify hooks exist: `ls -la .git/hooks/`\n\n## Test 2: Store conversation on commit (simulated)\n```bash\n# Create a sample hook input JSON\necho '{\"session_id\":\"test-123\",\"transcript_path\":\"/tmp/test-transcript.jsonl\",\"tool_name\":\"Bash\",\"tool_input\":{\"command\":\"git commit -m test\"}}' | claudit store\n```\n**Expected:**\n- If no transcript exists, should log warning and exit silently\n- With valid transcript, should store as git note on HEAD\n\n## Test 3: Sync commands\n```bash\n# Push notes to remote\nclaudit sync push --remote origin\n\n# Pull notes from remote  \nclaudit sync pull --remote origin\n```\n**Expected:**\n- Push/pull operations succeed or warn gracefully if no notes exist\n\n## Test 4: Version check\n```bash\nclaudit --version\n```\n**Expected:** Shows `claudit version 0.1.0`\n\n## Test 5: Full integration (with Claude Code)\n1. Run `claudit init` in a repo\n2. Use Claude Code to make changes and commit\n3.
